This "Hello World" app is my first stab at learning the basics of the MEAN application stack.

My first attempt at learning the MEAN application stack was to follow the documentation at:

MEAN.io - A Fullstack Javascript Framework
<http://mean.io>

The first problem with this approach was that by doing this, I was trying to learn a large number of tools at the same time and became hopelessly confused.

Rather, I decided to tackle the MEAN stack in pieces and go through the tutorials for each of the tools separately and come up with something that was essentially the MEAN stack independantly.  This documents that effort and results.  

My next effort, armed with a general understanding of the underlying tools, will be to go back to the MEAN stack and see if it makes more sense.


_mongoDB_

The simplest tool to learn in the framework is the database: mongoDB.

_node.js_

Another simple tool to learn in the framework is the core server application engine: node.js.  Because I was going to building on top of the express framework, I just got node.js up and running with the most basic "Hello World" app and moved on.

_express_

Express is the server framework where the business logic is handled. This is one of the big areas of learning.

With the goal of writing a Javascript powered client application for the user interface (using AngularJS); my focus was in writing a behind-the-scenes RESTful web api with Express.

_AngularJS_

AngularJS is the client framework where the user interface is handled. This is another area that required substantial learning.
